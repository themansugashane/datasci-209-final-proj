    <h2>Our Project</h2>

    <p>
        What truly determines how long people live? While GDP is often treated as a benchmark for national well-being, 
        it tells only part of the story. Our project, <strong>Exploring Life Expectancy: Going Beyond GDP</strong>, 
        aims to dig deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
        We explore why countries with similar levels of economic output can have very different health outcomes. 
        By focusing on three key drivers of education spending, 
        <strong>healthcare investment and access, and CO₂ emissions</strong>, we examine how social policy and 
        environmental conditions shape life expectancy across nations.
    </p>

    <p>
        We aim to uncover meaningful insights that explain how targeted investments in people and the environment 
        contribute to longer, healthier lives. Our goal is to support better decision-making. By identifying the 
        factors that most strongly influence longevity, we hope to provide policymakers, researchers, and public 
        health advocates with data they can use to design more effective and equitable strategies.
