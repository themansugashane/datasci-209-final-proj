    <p>
        What truly determines how long people live? While GDP is often treated as a benchmark for national well-being, 
        it tells only part of the story. Our project, <strong>Exploring Life Expectancy: Going Beyond GDP</strong>, 
        aims to dig deeper. We explore why countries with similar levels of economic output can have very different health outcomes. 
        By focusing on three key drivers of education spending, 
        <strong>healthcare investment and access, and CO₂ emissions</strong>, we examine how social policy and 
        environmental conditions shape life expectancy across nations.
    </p>

    <p>
        We aim to uncover meaningful insights that explain how targeted investments in people and the environment 
        contribute to longer, healthier lives. Our goal is to give policymakers, researchers, and public health advocates 
        an exploratory foundation they can build on. One that helps them investigate why certain strategies succeed, 
        where others fall short, and how their own country's policies and outcomes have evolved over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        By drawing on our four visualizations of regional comparisons, global peer comparisons, 
        trend comparisons over time, and contrasts among countries with similar 
        GDP, we provide a multi-layered perspective that goes well beyond simple economic metrics. 
        These visuals allow us to highlight patterns such as how neighboring countries with shared histories
        diverge in health outcomes, which nations with similar spending or emissions can serve as policy models, 
        and how shifts in investment or environmental impact correspond with changes in life expectancy over 
        the past two decades. Together, these visuals help reveal which strategies consistently lead to better health 
        outcomes and which gaps may be holding countries back. Ultimately, we hope to support exploratory decision-making
        by equipping users with clear, data-driven evidence that can guide more effective and equitable decisions and research.

    <h2>Data Source</h2>

    <p>
        The data for this project comes from 
        <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org" target="_blank">Our World in Data</a></strong>, 
        which provides a wide range of country-level datasets used to build each visual on this webpage. 
        We used their publicly available indicators on yearly life expectancy, healthcare spending, universal 
        healthcare coverage, education spending, CO₂ emissions, and GDP. These datasets span the past two decades 
        and were combined using country and year to create a unified view to analyze how these factors relate to 
        life expectancy among different countries over time.
